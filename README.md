<h1 align=centre > Nurique </h1>
<h3 align="center"> Our inspiration for "Nurique" stems from a deep commitment to improving the dyslexic and others suffering from related issues like (dementia, arthritis, RIS, and much more) through multisensory games and activities and a belief that everyone should have access to personalized activities on their current state. We were motivated by the challenges faced by individuals with dyslexia and memory-related difficulties, and the desire to create a project that could empower them to overcome these challenges.

Further we were inspired by the research papers published [https://prayatna.co.in/multisensory-learning-for-dyslexia/], [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221057032_Multisensory_Games_for_Dyslexic_Children], [https://www.pearsonclinical.co.uk/content/dam/school/global/clinical/uk-clinical/files/Q4_Clinical_Assets/D0069-Dyslexia-Handy-Guide-Brochure.pdf]

Another inspiration is that the problem statement really exists and is not given that much attention **. We were also inspired by personalities like **Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison, Da Vinci, Abhishek Bachchan, and many more. These personalities were able to overcome the barriers of dyslexia excel in their field of interest and contribute to the world these examples proves that dyslexic person have the caliber to excel if they figure out how to deal with dyslexia

We have churned out innovative multisensory games and activities to improve the condition of the user in a gradual and personalized way based on test and.</h3>

<h2>What is Nuriquw?</h2>

Nurique is an innovative project that revolutionizes the training, and assessment of dyslexic patients (dementia, RSI, ). It would act as a go-to for the patients for daily personal training.

This project includes assessing the user by an assessment test and grading him based on the score he received High Dyslexic, Medium Dyslexic, and low Dyslexic. Based on the current grade, He/she is given a task and required to complete the specific multisensory game-which includes more than one sense, aptitude, agility, and maths.

Using Nurique and training on a regular basis would improve and enhance the grade of the particular patient and help him to keep dyslexia under control.

<h2>Our Approach</h2>
Frontend Development:

React Frontend: The user interface and interactive components of "Nurique" were built using React, a popular JavaScript library for creating responsive and dynamic web applications. This choice allowed us to provide a highly interactive and user-friendly platform.

Tailwind CSS Styling: For styling and design, we employed Tailwind CSS. Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach enabled us to efficiently style the user interface, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing look and feel.

Authentication SSO with Firebase: We integrated Firebase Authentication to enable Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality. Users can seamlessly log in and access the platform using their Firebase credentials, ensuring a secure and straightforward login process.

Backend Development:

JavaScript Backend Logic: Our backend logic and server-side functionality were developed using JavaScript. This includes server logic for handling user data, interactions, and game-related processes. Database:

Firestore Database: "Nurique" leverages Firestore, a NoSQL cloud database provided by Firebase. Firestore was used to store user profiles, progress data, and game-related information. It enables real-time data synchronization and ensures that user information is readily available and consistently updated.

Development Workflow:

The development process for "Nurique" followed an agile methodology, which allowed for ongoing iterations and improvements based on user feedback. Regular testing and quality assurance ensured that the platform met high standards of performance and reliability. trial and error method. Agile. Thoght on possible cases which could occurs on the perspective of the problem statement

<h2>Challenger we ran into </h2>

The Measuring Impact: Quantifying the impact of your project on dyslexic individuals can be challenging. Develop metrics and assessment tools to track progress and improvement. How we could categorize the patients based on the points of the assessment test?

Finding the relevant questions- to assess the particular user, the unawareness of the technologies of the condition of dyslexia

Difficulties in analysing -The real-time progress and structuring the workflow of the project
